      - **Previous Course (Existing Version):** This is the course before any updates:  
        ${main_course}  
    
      - **Updated Course (New Version):** This is the revised course that replaces or updates the Previous Course:  
        ${merge_course}  
    
      ---
    
      ## üîç Task  
      Compare the **Updated Course** with the **Previous Course** and provide a structured summary of differences.  
      **Ignore metadata** such as timestamps, author names, course IDs, or any unrelated system-generated details.  
    
      ---
    
      ## ‚ú® Analysis Requirements  
      - **New Additions:** Identify newly introduced topics, lessons, or sections that were **not present** in the Previous Course.  
      - **Modifications:** Highlight **content changes**, including rewording, expansion, restructuring, or updates.  
      - **Removals:** List any topics or lessons that **existed in the Updated Course but are absent** in the Previous Course.  
      - **Reorganization:** Detect **structural changes**, such as reordering, merging, or shifting of topics.  
    
      ---
    
      ## üìå Output Formatting Instructions  
      - Use **Markdown** for **better readability**.  
      - Present findings using:  
        - **Tables** for structured comparisons.  
        - **Bullet points** for concise descriptions.  
      - Ensure the response is **clear, professional, and visually appealing**.  
      - Use **bold headings** for sections and **formatted tables** to enhance clarity.

      ## üìä Expected Output Format  
    
      ### üîÑ Chapter-Level Changes  
      | Chapter | Previous Course | Updated Course | Change Type | Description |
      |---------|----------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
      | 1 | Introduction | AI/ML Fundamentals | Modified | Expanded with AI types, history, and streamlined explanations. |
      | 2 | Types of ML | Supervised Learning | Modified & Reorganized | Supervised learning content enhanced; other ML types moved to Chapter 1. |
      | 3 | Supervised Learning | Unsupervised Learning | Modified & Reorganized | Covers clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical) and PCA with Python examples. |
      | 4 | Unsupervised Learning | N/A | Removed | Integrated into Chapter 3 with practical code examples. |
      | 5 | Reinforcement Learning | N/A | Removed | No longer part of this course. |
      | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
    
      ### ‚úÖ Key Additions  
      - **Focused content** on AI/ML fundamentals, including AI types (Narrow, General, Super AI).  
      - **Python code examples** for key algorithms (linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, K-Means, PCA, t-SNE).  
      - **Clear separation** of supervised and unsupervised learning concepts.  
    
      ### ‚úçÔ∏è Key Modifications  
      - **Introduction restructured** to include ML types and terminology.  
      - **Supervised learning streamlined**, focusing on essential algorithms while removing KNN.  
      - **Algorithm descriptions** now integrated within their respective learning paradigms.  
    
      ### ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Removals  
      - **Dedicated chapters on Reinforcement Learning, Applications, Future Trends, and Advanced Topics** (Deep Learning, NLP).  
      - **Simplified example models** (e.g., KNN) removed.  
    
      ### üîÑ Structural Changes  
      - **Algorithm discussions are now within their respective sections** instead of a separate chapter.  
      - **ML types discussion moved to the Introduction** instead of a standalone chapter.  
    
      This revised course offers a **more structured, practical introduction to AI/ML** with essential concepts, algorithms, and coding examples while removing advanced topics to keep it **beginner-friendly**.
